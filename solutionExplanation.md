### Solution

The `minEnd` function takes two parameters: an integer `n`, which represents the number of bits to consider, and an integer `x`, and it aims to find the minimum integer that ends with `x` after applying specific conditions. The function leverages bit manipulation and `BigInt` arithmetic to ensure precision with large values.

### Let's go through the code step-by-step:

#### Function Signature and Initial Setup

```javascript
var minEnd = function(n, x) {
    let result = BigInt(x);
    let remaining = BigInt(n - 1);
    let position = 1n;
```

- **`result`**: Initialized to `BigInt(x)`. This will hold the final result.
- **`remaining`**: Set to `BigInt(n - 1)`, representing the bits left to process in `x` (or potential ones we may need to add).
- **`position`**: A variable used to track the current bit position in the number, starting from the least significant bit (position `1n`).

#### Main Loop: Processing Each Bit Position

```javascript
    while (remaining > 0n) {
        if ((BigInt(x) & position) === 0n) {
            result |= (remaining & 1n) * position;
            remaining >>= 1n;
        }
        position <<= 1n;
    }
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The loop continues until `remaining` becomes `0`, indicating no more bits need to be checked or added.
  - Inside the loop:
    - **Check if the current bit in `x` is `0`**: This is done by `BigInt(x) & position`. If this result equals `0n`, then the bit at the current `position` in `x` is not set.
    - **Add a bit from `remaining` if needed**:
      - The expression `(remaining & 1n) * position` will be non-zero only if the current least significant bit of `remaining` is `1`.
      - `result |= (remaining & 1n) * position` effectively sets this bit in `result` if required.
      - **Shift** `remaining` one bit to the right (`remaining >>= 1n`) to remove the bit we just used.
    - **Advance the bit position**: `position <<= 1n` shifts `position` to the next bit position to the left.

#### Return Result

```javascript
    return Number(result);
};
```

- **Return**: After processing all bits, `result` is converted back to a regular `Number` type for the final result.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example

Suppose:
- **Input**: `n = 4`, `x = 3`
- **Explanation**:
  - Convert `x` and `n` to `BigInt` types as needed.
  - **Binary of `x = 3`**: `0011` in binary.
  - The algorithm attempts to fill bits in `result` using bits from `remaining` without changing the existing set bits in `x`.
  - Process each bit position as described, adjusting `result` as necessary to achieve the minimum integer ending with `x`.
  - **Final `result`** might contain additional bits from `remaining` while preserving `x`.

#### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log(n))\), as the loop iterates over bit positions, which scales logarithmically with `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as only a constant amount of additional space is used.

The `minEnd` function efficiently uses bitwise operations to achieve the minimum integer result, ensuring high performance with large inputs.
